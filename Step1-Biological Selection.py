# Biological sequence selection - 
# “Given an unknown or hypothetical biological sequence, how can we computationally analyze it to predict its quality, similarity, and biological function?”


# Ans - In modern genomics and virology, large numbers of new or poorly 
# characterized sequences are continuously generated through high-throughput 
# sequencing technologies. Experimental characterization of every sequence 
# is often time-consuming, expensive, and impractical. 
# Therefore, computational sequence analysis provides a critical first layer of biological insight.

#sequence quality analysis ensures that the input data is reliable and biologically meaningful

# Homology-based similarity searches reveal evolutionary relationships and conserved regions

# Functional annotation transfers known biological knowledge from well-characterized homologs

# Biological interpretation integrates all computational evidence to propose a plausible function

# By applying this structured approach to a Dengue virus polyprotein–derived sequence, 
# the study demonstrates how an initially uncharacterized viral protein can be transformed into a functionally interpretable biological entity
#  using only computational tools.
